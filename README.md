# Simple Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) Challenge

This is my solution to the "Simple Frequently Asked Questions" challenge from [devChallenges.io](https://devchallenges.io).

## Project Overview

The goal of this project was to build a clean, responsive FAQ component that functions well on both mobile and desktop devices. This challenge helped me practice my semantic HTML and CSS layout skills.

### Built With

* **HTML5:** For structured and semantic web content.
* **CSS3:** For styling, including Flexbox/Grid for responsiveness.
* **GitHub Pages:** For hosting the live demo.

## Features

- [x] Responsive layout for mobile and desktop.
- [x] Hover states for interactive elements.
- [x] Accessible HTML structure.

## My Process

During this project, I learned how to properly organize a GitHub repository to host a live site. One of the main challenges was ensuring the `index.html` was in the root directory so that GitHub Pages could deploy it correctly.
